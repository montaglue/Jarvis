# Jarvis

My console application which provides universal interfaces for work with projects. I often get to switch between typescript and rust projects and I want to make it more comfort. 

## Languages
- [x] Rust
- [x] Typescript
- [ ] Lean
- [ ] Python

## Projects configs
Configs situated in `.jarvis` file in json format. They will generate automaticaly for new projects. For others I will add examples later. 


## Commands
